Meeting time: 9:00am – 1:00pm, M-F, plus project work

Instructor: Eric Collins (recollins alaska edu)

Textbook: None. Readings will be taken from the primary literature.

Supplemental Reading:
“Applied Predictive Modeling” by Kuhn and Johnson. ISBN: 9781461468486 (recommended)

Supplies: Internet-enabled portable computer is required. A dozen laptops are available from the CFOS academic office, please contact the instructor for assistance.

Course Content: Recent advances in computer power have enabled data scientists to analyze ever-larger datasets using machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, making the ability to process these datasets an integral training requirement for the next generation of environmental scientists. This course will focus on training students in environmental fields such as fisheries, oceanography, geography, hydrology, and wildlife biology in the use of modern computational tools for machine learning applications.

Expected Proficiencies: Undergraduate-level understanding of basic statistics and programming in at least one language (preferably Python, R, or MATLAB).

Catalog Description: 
MSL F695 Machine Learning in the Environmental Sciences
3 Credits   Special Topics

Introduces the concepts of machine learning in the context of the environmental sciences e.g. fisheries, oceanography, geography, hydrology, wildlife biology, etc. using free, open-source software. Covers methods in supervised and unsupervised learning in problems related to classification, regression, and dimensional reduction drawn from environmentally relevant datasets. Prerequisites: CS103 or CS201 or CS405 or BIOL680 or GEOS436 or GEOS636 or MSL464 or MSL604 or MSL627 or MSL631 or MSL632 or STAT200 or STAT401 or STAT641 or graduate standing or by permission of the instructor. (3+0)

Course Goals: The goal of this course is to introduce modern computational tools in machine learning to students in environmental fields like fisheries, oceanography, geography, hydrology, and wildlife biology.

Student Learning Outcomes:
Upon completion of the course students will be able to:

1.	Use a command-line environment to conduct routine tasks on the computer (e.g. the bash shell).
2.	Write simple scripts using at least one machine learning toolkit (e.g. scikit-learn or TensorFlow).
3.	Find, download, install, and use software and datasets from public repositories (e.g. from Github or Google Earth Engine).
4.	Apply appropriate concepts and algorithms in machine learning to real world problems (e.g. supervised learning, classification).
5.	Analyze a real environmental sciences dataset using machine learning.

Instructional Methods: The in-class course time will consist of lectures on concepts and algorithms, in addition to a group project where students will gain hands-on experience working with real datasets.

Evaluation: Students will be evaluated based on class participation, homework, a group project, and a final presentation. Grading is absolute.

Class Participation (10%, 100 points), including on-time attendance at lecture and engagement with classmates, will be expected of each student, and evaluated according to the following rubric (also available at https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/assessment/examples/courselevel-bycollege/cfa/tools/participationrubric-cfa.pdf)
 
Homework in the form of Computational Exercises (40%, 400 points) will be required showing proficiency in the use of machine learning tools. Homework will be provided during class and will be due the next day. Late homework will not be accepted.

A Group Project (40%, 400 points) will be required. The product will be organized as a scientific manuscript (>2500 words) based upon an independent computational analysis using skills developed in class. The topic of the Group Project will be agreed upon with the instructor by Day 4, and may use public datasets or the student’s own dataset. Publishing criteria from the journal PLoS ONE will be used as guidance: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication

The Final Presentation (10%, 100 points) will be based on the Group Project; students are expected to explain their findings in a professional manner in a 15-minute conference-style presentation on the last day.
Course Policies: Students are expected to read the relevant material prior to the lectures and attend class in a timely manner. Active participation is expected. The use of cell phones or other electronic communications (e.g. email, twitter, facebook etc.) during class is considered inappropriate. Students should be familiar with the UAF Honor Code (https://www.uaf.edu/catalog/catalog_00-01/undergrad/regs3.html). Cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated. Any student found cheating during the exams or to have plagiarized or fabricated statements (including passages from web pages) will receive an automatic 'F' for the class.

The following non-curved grading system will be used for the entire course: 
A+ >95%
A  >90 – 95%
A− >85 – 90%
B+ >80 – 85%
B  >75 – 80%
B− >70 – 75%
C+ >67 – 70%
C  >63 – 67%
C− >60 – 63%

Grades below C− will not count toward the major or minor degree requirements
D  50 – 60% 
F  <50

Support Services: At UAF, the Office of Disability Services (203 Whitaker Bldg; 474-5655; TTY 474-5655; fydso@uaf.edu, http://www.uaf.edu/disability) ensures that students with physical or learning disabilities have equal access to the campus and course materials.
